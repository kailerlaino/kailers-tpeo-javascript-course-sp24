# Week 2 Homework

Write a function named sumOfSquareAreas that takes two parameters: a and b, which each represent the side lengths of two different squares. Return the value of the sum of the areas of these squares (for example, if a = 9 and b = 3, then we want to return 90). Then, call this function 3 times with different values for a and b and output the results to the terminal by running your code.

Write a function named gradeCalculator that takes three parameters: homeworkAvg, quizAvg, and examAvg, which each represent your average for a class on homework, quizzes, and exams, respectively. Return the value of your overall grade in the class if homework is weighted at 10%, quizzes are 15%, and exams are 75%. Then, call this function 3 times with different values for homeworkAvg, quizAvg, and examAvg and output the results to the terminal by running your code.
