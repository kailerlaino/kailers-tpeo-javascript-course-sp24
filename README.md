# Fork Environment
This repository will be using a fork structure, meaning that fellows will **commit to their own local respository** while **pulling new weekly content from this one**. Weekly content will be updated on the master branch, but a copy of all previous week's content will be available via branches.

**Note: From now on we will be referring to aarushi-lakhi/tpeo-javascript-course-sp24 project as the **main** repo and other repositories as the **forked** repo. 
## Forking the Repository 
Navigate to a directory where you'd like to keep all your projects. If you haven't already, we would recommend creating a folder like ```GitHub_Projects```
1. Go onto the **main** repository's Github page and click the **Fork** button
2. Clone the repository locally in your project folder of choice by performing 
    ``` 
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
3. We need to set the **forked** repo's upstream url, allowing you to pull changes from the **main**, perform
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/tpeo/<REPO_NAME>.git
    ```
4. Verify that the forked repo has the following remote properties by performing ```git remote -v```
    ```
    $ git remote -v
    > origin    https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git (fetch)
    > origin    https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git(push)
    > upstream  https://github.com/tpeo/<REPO_NAME>.git (fetch)
    > upstream  https://github.com/tpeo/<REPO_NAME>.git (push)
    ```
## Commiting Changes To the Forked Repository

1. Add files 
    ``` 
    git add <files> 
    ``` 
2. Commit changes
    ```
    git commit -m"<YOUR MESSAGE HERE>"
    ```
3. Push
    ```
    git push origin main 
    ```
## Pulling Changes From Main Repository
You should pull approximately every week when new content arrives. These steps will involve merging the main repository's ```main``` branch with a forked repository's ```main``` branch 
1. Make sure you are on the appropriate branch
    ```
    git checkout main  
    ```
2. Fetch Content from Main Repository
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    ```
3. Merge Upstream with current local branch
    ```
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

## Suggesting Changes to the Main Repository 
We realize that we're not perfect so we would love to hear constructive feedback and you can do so by opening a pull request to the main repository

## Optional: Folder Generation Script
This repository contains a script that allows users to easily create new folders for weekly lessons. Navigate to the repo folder and type 
```
source generate.sh <NAME_OF_FOLDER>
```
We recommend replacing <NAME_OF_FOLDER> with something like "Week_X".
